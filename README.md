# Vesper-Example-Archive

This example [Vesper](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper) archive contains clips collected by [Old Bird](http://oldbird.org) between August 27 and September 3, 2014 at four stations in the northeastern United States. The data include about 4000 nocturnal flight call clips and about half as many noise clips. Roughly half of the calls are classified to species. Classification was performed by Bill Evans, but should not be interpreted as final. The data are provided only to help people understand and evaluate Vesper.
